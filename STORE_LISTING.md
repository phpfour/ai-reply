### Key Features

**Context-Aware Replies**

**Tone Control**
Choose from Auto, Friendly, Humorous, or Engaging tones to match your style and the conversation.

**Personalization**
Add your name, occupation, and background so replies reflect your expertise and personality.

Set specific guidelines like "keep replies under 280 characters" or "always mention my expertise when relevant."

**Natural Typing Simulation**
Replies are typed character-by-character to work seamlessly with React-based platforms.
